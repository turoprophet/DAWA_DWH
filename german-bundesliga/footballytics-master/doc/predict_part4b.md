Now we can apply the model to the test dataset (i.e. Week 38 in Season 2014-2015)
and make some predictions. The table below shows the comparsion between predicted 
and actual outcomes of the ten matches in the final week.

The simple model would have **correctly predicted 6 out of 10 matches**. 
Yet, it would not be profitable as the odds for some of the home wins were relatively low.
