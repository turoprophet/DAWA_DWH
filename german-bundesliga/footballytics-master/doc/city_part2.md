<center><h2>Overtaking Arsenal</h2></center>

In December 2009, Mark Hughes was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini. City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League. In season 2010-2011, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1968 after a victory against fifth placed Tottenham. City kept the momentum and passed Arsenal for third place in the league, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.
