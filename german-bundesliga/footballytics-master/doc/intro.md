This web app is my first attempt at developing data-driven sports stories with R.

Since I started learning about Python and R back in early 2013, data gurus 
[Ramnath Vaidyanathan](https://github.com/ramnathv), 
[Kenton Russell](https://github.com/timelyportfolio),
[Alex Bresler](https://github.com/abresler) and
[Hadley Wickham](https://github.com/hadley) have been helping me in many ways and providing very specific technical support. I would like to thank them for their continuous support, encouragement and commitment to the open-source data science community.

First, please check out one of the **headline stores - "The Rise of the City"**. The navigation menu is either on the left or top depending on your device's screen resolution. *Landscape mode* is recommended if you are viewing this on a smartphone.
