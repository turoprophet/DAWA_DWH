<center><h2>Race for the Final Champions League Place</h2></center>

Winning the Premier League is, of course, the ultimate prize for all 20 teams involved, but almost as important is the race to finish somewhere in the top four positions. The most lucrative reward for success in the EPL is the chance to compete in the UEFA Champions League (formerly known as the European Cup), a Europe-wide competition for the continent’s elite clubs. Each year, every member nation submits a certain number of teams to compete in the tournament, and fixtures are played alongside the regular season, usually on midweek evenings. The number of teams each league contributes is dependent on their success in previous years, and at the moment the EPL has four spaces.

Simply playing in the Champions League, never mind winning it, offers huge financial reward due to the lucrative television and sponsorship deals the competition possesses. As such, finishing in the top four is a major target for many English clubs, as the increased funding can help establish them as one of the league’s power teams.

As a matter of fact, Arsenal's Manager [Arsène Wenger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars%C3%A8ne_Wenger) is special in his own way!
